# Instructions:
# Write a function map_bitstring that takes a list of bitstrings
# (i.e., 0101) and maps each bitstring to 0 if the number of 0s
# in the bitstring strictly exceeds the number of 1s. Otherwise,
# map that bitstring to 1. The output of your function is a
# dictionary of the so-described key-value pairs.

def map_bitstring(list_of_bits):
    '''
    This function takes in a list of bitstrings and returns a
    dictionary where the keys are the individual bitstrings, and
    the values are either 0 (when the bitstring has more 0s than
    1s) or 1 (when the bitsring has more 1s than 0s).

    :param list_of_bits: input list of bits to be parsed
    :return: dictionary with respective mappings
    '''

    # check that list of bits is only ints


    return
